# HomeSeer Scripts

This is a collection of vb.net scripts that I have written for my HomeSeer installation.

## Description

The folder standalone-scripts is the original collection of scripts that were written as they were
needed, sharing code and functions from other scripts as needed. Over time, this has gotten messy,
as a lot of code and functions has been shared.

A new collection of files will be replacing these files that are built in a more single-purpose
fashion. That process is currently a work in progress.

## Purpose

I started writing these scripts as my HomeSeer setup got more and more complicated, with status
changes triggering tracking device changes, which would trigger additional events, and so on. When
I had a system crash, I decided instead of restoring from a backup, I would take that opportunity
to redesign my system to handle the complex decision making in code instead of the relatively
simple IFTTT-style logic available in the events configuration (although it is still more powerful
than IFTTT).

## Contributing

I'm putting this out on the internet so anyone looking to do similar tasks as I am can save some
work. I tend to learn from copying and changing, and maybe others do too. Take these and use them
however you want. If anyone actually wants to fork or contribute, go ahead. I am actually using
these scripts in my setup, however, so forking (or just copying and changing) is probably easier.
